The ouput of Data Factory is a set of research-grade data containing the biomarkers extracted
from MRI scans and the variables extracted from the patient (or research subject) EHR records.

This information is sent to the [Hospital Database](../../hospital-database) and provided to the
machine learning and statistical analysis algorithms of the [Algorithm Factory](../algorithm-factory)
as well as the [distributed queries](../../hospital-database/distributed-queries) when the instance of
MIP at a hospital is connected to the Federation.
