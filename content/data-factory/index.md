## Goals

The main role of the __Data Factory__ is to take data coming from [__Data capture__](../data-capture) , process it offline (without any user interaction) then store the results into a database of the __Hospital Database Bundle__.

```
  anonymised data => pre-processing + ETL + automated curation => data store
```
