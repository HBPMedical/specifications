A module that performs anonymisation is provided by MIP when the hospital does not have the tools to perform the de-personalisation of all data.

The following is used only when the GNUBILA Pandora FedEHR anonymiser has been setup.

### Data folder organisation for the anonymisation processing

The software [GNUBILA Pandora FedEHR](https://corporate.gnubila.fr/fedehr) is used to perform the de-personalisation of all EHR and imaging data.

```
    /data
    ├── anonymiser             -- This folder contains all the data being processed.
    │   ├── db                 -- This contains the database of the internal IDs to public IDs mappings
    │   ├── in                 -- Files to be processed.
    │   ├── out                -- Files successfuly anonymised.
    │   ├── pacs               -- Used when Pandora FedEHR is configured to connect to a PACS system
    │   │   ├── csv            --  * EHR data

    │   │   └── unknown        --  * Any other kind of failures

Please be aware that as part of the anonymisation, files are **moved** from the
input folder to the quarantine folder, or to the output folder (after the
modification have been applied).

Make sure to place a copy into the input folder, if you need to keep the 
original file.


Once the DICOM files are anonymised and validated, they should be moved to the `/data/df/in/` folder to be processed by the Data Factory.

Once the EHR files are anonymised and validated, they should be moved to the `/data/mipmap/in/` folder to be harmonized by MIPMap.
