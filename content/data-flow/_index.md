## Flow of data in the platform

One of the main purpose of the Medical Informatics Platform is to collect and process clinical and research data
and put into the hand of its users (clinicians, researchers in neuroscience) ready-to-use data containing
the variables and features made available for research.

The machine learning algorithms and statistical analysis methods provided by the platform are using this feature data
when a user is exploring data or performing an experiment.
